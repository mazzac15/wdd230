                <h3>Spruce Creek Park</h3>
                <p>Scenic Spruce Creek Park is on 23 acres in Port Orange. Its 536-foot boardwalk begins more than three miles of nature trails leading to the 15-foot observation tower and continues to Rose Bay. The tower overlooks the marsh area near Spruce Creek.
                    The extension began on the north side of the park as part of the Rose Bay Legacy Project Program under the direction of a teacher at Mainland High School. The students notched out minimum-impact nature trails and planted native vegetation throughout the area while studying the environment. Students from Mainland High School, Campbell Middle School, South Daytona Elementary, Holly Hill Elementary, and many other students and teachers have worked with community members and state and county agency mentors to help construct trails, monitor the environment, remove exotic species, and renourish the wetlands.</p>
                <p>Features: Picnicking, Playground, and Canoe launch</p>

                <h3>Sugar Mill Botanical Garden</h3> 
                <p>Sugar Mill Gardens is a botanical garden developed and maintained by the Botanical Gardens of Volusia Inc., a nonprofit organization with no salaried employees. It features a 19th-century sugar factory; part of the former Dunlawton Plantation.

                    The property was donated in 1963 to the County of Volusia by J. Saxton Lloyd and operated since April 1988 by the non-profit Botanical Gardens of Volusia Inc.
                    
                    The gardens provide an inexpensive, wholesome family environment where you can stroll through trails, view the sugar mill and statues of dinosaurs from an early theme park, watch butterflies, and learn more about flora and fauna native to Florida.
                    
                    Please read and follow the rules posted at the entrance gate and on the Gardens website. </p>
